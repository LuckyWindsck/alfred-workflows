# Toggle Alfred With F4

This workflow allows users to toggle Alfred with an alternative shortcut, `F4`.

## Why?
New M1 Macbooks have a function key to open Spotlight.
I'd like to use the spotlight key to toggle Alfred, while having my previous shortcut works as well.

Note that users need to either use `fn + F4` to send `F4` keycode or use other software like [Karabiner-Elements](https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org/) to map the spotlight key to `F4` key.
